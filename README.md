## Node Js

1. ### What is NodeJS?

   Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, **JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser**. Node JS was created by [Ryan Dahl](https://github.com/ry), Ryan Dahl is a software engineer and the original developer of the Node.js JavaScript runtime.

2. ### How can you avoid callback hells?

   There are lots of ways to solve the issue of callback hells: <br /> 1.modularization: break callbacks into independent functions, <br /> 2.use a control flow library, like async. <br /> 3.use generators with Promises, <br /> 4.use async/await (note that it is only available in the latest v7 release and not in the LTS version

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#table-of-contents---node-js)**

3. ### When are background or worker processes useful?

   Worker processes are extremely useful if you'd like to do data processing in the background, like sending out emails or processing images.
   <br/>
   There are lots of options for this like RabbitMQ or Kafka.

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#table-of-contents---node-js)**

4. ### Why is NodeJS Single threaded?

   Node.js is single-threaded for async processing. By doing async processing on a single-thread under typical web loads, more performance and scalability can be achieved as opposed to the typical thread-based implementation.

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#table-of-contents---node-js)**

5. ### Name the types of API functions in Node?

   There are two types of functions in Node.js. <br/>
   1.Blocking functions - In a blocking operation, all other code is blocked from executing until an I/O event that is being waited on occurs. Blocking functions execute synchronously. <br/>2.Non-blocking functions - In a non-blocking operation, multiple I/O calls can be performed without the execution of the program being halted. Non-blocking functions execute asynchronously.

6. ### Explain chaining in Nodejs?

   Chaining is a mechanism whereby the output of one stream is connected to another stream creating a chain of multiple stream operations.

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#table-of-contents---node-js)**

7. ### What are streams in Nodejs Explain the different types of streams present in Nodejs?

   Streams are objects that allow the reading of data from the source and writing of data to the destination as a continuous process.<br/>
   There are four types of streams.<br/>
   <Readable> to facilitate the reading operation.<br/>
   <Writable> to facilitate the writing operation.<br/>
   <Duplex> to facilitate both read and write operations.<br/>
   <Transform> is a form of Duplex stream that performs computations based on the available input.<br/>

8. ### What is package json?

   The package.json file in Node.js is the heart of the entire application. It is basically the manifest file that contains the metadata of the project where we define the properties of a package.

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#table-of-contents---node-js)**

9. ### Explain the purpose of module exports?

   A module in Node.js is used to encapsulate all the related codes into a single unit of code which can be interpreted by shifting all related functions into a single file

10. ### List down the major security implementations within Nodejs?

    Major security implementations in Node.js are:Authentications,Error Handling

11. ### Explain the concept of URL module?

    The URL module splits up a web address into readable parts

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#table-of-contents---node-js)**


12. ### Explain the concept of middleware in Nodejs?
    In Node.js, the spawn() is used to launch a new process with the provided set of commands. This method doesn’t create a new V8 instance and just one copy of the node module is active on the processor. When your child process returns a large amount of data to the Node you can invoke this method.

**[ Back to Top ⬆ ](#table-of-contents---node-js)**

16. ### Explain the purpose of ExpressJS package?

    Express.js is a framework built on top of Node.js that facilitates the management of the flow of data between server and routes in the server-side applications. It is a lightweight and flexible framework that provides a wide range of features required for the web as well as mobile application development. Express.js is developed on the middleware module of Node.js called connect. The connect module further makes use of http module to communicate with Node.js. Thus, if you are working with any of the connect based middleware modules, then you can easily integrate with Express.js.

17. ### Explain the usage of a buffer class in Nodejs?

    Buffer class in Node.js is used for storing the raw data in a similar manner of an array of integers. But it corresponds to a raw memory allocation that is located outside the V8 heap. It is a global class that is easily accessible can be accessed in an application without importing a buffer module. Buffer class is used because pure JavaScript is not compatible with binary data. So, when dealing with TCP streams or the file system, it’s necessary to handle octet streams.

18. ### How does Nodejs handle the child threads?

    In general, Node.js is a single threaded process and doesn’t expose the child threads or thread management methods. But you can still make use of the child threads using spawn() for some specific asynchronous I/O tasks which execute in the background and don’t usually execute any JS code or hinder with the main event loop in the application. If you still want to use the threading concept in your application you have to include a module called ChildProcess explicitly.

19. ### Explain stream in Nodejs along with its various types?

    Streams in Node.js are the collection of data similar to arrays and strings. They are objects using which you can read data from a source or write data to a destination in a continuous manner. It might not be available at once and need not to have fit in the memory. These streams are especially useful for reading and processing a large set of data. In Node.js, there are four fundamental types of streams:<br/>
    Readable: Used for reading large chunks of data from the source.<br/>
    Writeable: Use for writing large chunks of data to the destination.<br/>
    Duplex: Used for both the functions; read and write.<br/>
    Transform: It is a duplex stream that is used for modifying the data.

20. ### Describe the exit codes of Nodejs?

    In Node.js, exit codes are a set of specific codes which are used for finishing a specific process. These processes can include the global object as well. Below are some of the exit codes used in Node.js:<br/>
	*Uncaught fatal exception<br/>
	*Unused<br/>
	*Fatal Error<br/>
	*Internal Exception handler Run-time failure<br/>
	*Internal JavaScript Evaluation Failure<br/>

21. ### Is cryptography supported in Nodejs?
    cluster.fork();
	}

	cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
    console.log(`worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
		});
	} 
	else {
		// Workers can share any TCP connection
		// In this case it is an HTTP server
	http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200);
    res.end('hello world\n');
	}).listen(8000);

	console.log(`Worker ${process.pid} started`);
	}
	
	//Running Node.js will now share port 8000 between the workers:
	
	$ node server.js
	Master 3596 is running
	Worker 4324 started
	Worker 4520 started
	Worker 6056 started
	Worker 5644 started
	```

29. ### What is the datatype of console?

    The datatype of console is an **object**

30. ### Which are the different console methods available?

    There are around 21 inbuilt console methods , we can also built our own prototypes using new Console constructor function<br/>
	here are a few popular one's<br/>
	1.**console.clear()** will clear only the output in the current terminal viewport for the Node.js binary.<br/>
	2.**console.error([data][, ...args])** Prints to stderr with newline. Multiple arguments can be passed, with the first used as the primary message and all additional used as substitution<br/>
	3.**console.table(tabularData[, properties])**  a table with the columns of the properties of tabularData (or use properties) and rows of tabularData and log it.
